# ðŸ’Ž New Discord RPC

Simple C# program that allows the user to create his own DicordRPC 
with a lot of different features.

### ðŸ‘‘Features:
- [x] ðŸ”µMinimize To System Tray
- [X] ðŸŸ£Save Presets
- [X] ðŸŸ Import Presets
- [X] ðŸŸ¢Images
- [X] ðŸŸ¡Buttons

Now you can save your own presets and then you can import them whenever you want so you
don't have to write them again, you can also minimize the application to the system tray
which is pretty useful so the application won't stay in the taskbar where you need more space
now you can also add you assets and also a button with a URL.

### Presentation:
During the realization of this project i made a simple GUI that you can 
modify, i used some open source NuGet packeges:
(RjCodeAdvance.RjControls, DiscordRichPresence)

This is the aspect of the GUI:

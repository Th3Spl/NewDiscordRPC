# New Discord RPC

Simple C# program that allows the user to create his own DicordRPC 
with a lot of different features.

### Features:
- [x] Minimize To System Tray
- [X] Save Presets
- [X] Import Presets
- [X] Images
- [X] Buttons

Now you can save your own presets and then you can import them whenever you want so you
don't have to write them again, you can also minimize the application to the system tray
which is pretty useful so the application won't stay in the taskbar where you need more space
now you can also add you assets and also a button with a URL.

### Presentation:
During the realization of this project i made a simple GUI that you can 
modify, i used some opem source NuGet packeges:
(RjCodeAdvance.RjControls, DiscordRichPresence, Newtonsoft.Json)

This is the aspect of the GUI:

And if you want to change something in the code or maybe you want to 
customize the GUI you can do it by yourself indeed you can download the 
source code of this project from this GitHub respository.
(Consider that i made this application for fun and i didn't optimize the code so don't bother me if is bad written!)
